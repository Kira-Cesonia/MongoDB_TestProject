# MongoDB_TestProject
A minimalistic MongoDB Test Project

This project is based on a Docker-instance of MongoDB that is definided in mongo_db/docker-compose.yml
For this project to run, the MongoDB container should first be run. 
Alternatively, any other instance of MongoDB can be used. In that case, the connection parameters have to be adjusted in the mongoDB.MongoDB_Connection class.
